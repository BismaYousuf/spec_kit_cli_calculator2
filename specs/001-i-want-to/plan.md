# Implementation Plan: Calculator with All Arithmetic Operations

**Branch**: `001-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-10-08 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-i-want-to/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a calculator application that performs all arithmetic operations as specified in the feature requirements. The calculator will support basic operations (+, -, *, /), advanced operations (exponents, square roots, percentages), history tracking, and proper error handling. Built with Python for cross-platform compatibility and mathematical accuracy.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11  
**Primary Dependencies**: pytest (testing), tkinter (GUI, if needed), decimal (for precision math)  
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory calculation history, optional file-based persistence)  
**Testing**: pytest with comprehensive mathematical accuracy test coverage  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)  
**Project Type**: Single project (console/CLI application with potential GUI)  
**Performance Goals**: <100ms for standard calculations, <200ms for complex operations  
**Constraints**: <50MB memory usage, 100% mathematical accuracy, decimal precision support  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user calculator, local execution, no concurrent users

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **Accuracy-First**: All mathematical operations will be validated against known standards using decimal module for precision and comprehensive pytest test suite
2. **Input Validation**: Input validation strategy implemented with checks for valid number formats, operation symbols, and edge cases like division by zero
3. **Test-First**: TDD approach confirmed with comprehensive pytest test coverage for all mathematical operations and accuracy requirements
4. **Performance Optimization**: Calculations will complete within performance goals (<100ms for basic, <200ms for complex) with performance monitoring
5. **Simplicity and Usability**: CLI interface designed to be intuitive with clear error messages and responsive feedback to meet accessibility requirements

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected to keep the calculator implementation simple and maintainable. The structure follows the service/model pattern with separate concerns for business logic, data models, and CLI interface.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
