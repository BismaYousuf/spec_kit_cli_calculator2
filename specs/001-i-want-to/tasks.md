# Tasks: Calculator with All Arithmetic Operations

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-i-want-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are required based on FR-004 from the spec which states "System MUST include comprehensive unit tests covering mathematical accuracy for all operations" and the Test-First principle from the constitution.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan with src/, tests/ directories
- [X] T002 Initialize Python project with requirements.txt including pytest, decimal module
- [X] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (flake8, black)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T004 Implement mathematical operation base framework with decimal precision (10 decimal places) ensuring accuracy
- [X] T005 [P] Setup input validation system for all calculator operations
- [X] T006 [P] Configure testing framework with mathematical accuracy verification using pytest
- [X] T007 Create base calculator model with core operations
- [X] T008 Configure error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases (division by zero)
- [X] T009 Setup performance monitoring for calculation timing

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic Arithmetic Operations (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering two numbers and an operation symbol and verifying the correct result is displayed.

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [X] T010 [P] [US1] Unit test for basic operations (+, -, *, /) in tests/unit/test_calculator_service.py
- [X] T011 [P] [US1] Contract test for /calculate endpoint in tests/contract/test_calculator_api.py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T012 [P] [US1] Create Calculation model in src/models/calculation.py
- [X] T013 [P] [US1] Create Calculator model in src/models/calculator.py
- [X] T014 [US1] Implement basic calculation service in src/services/calculator_service.py (depends on T012, T013)
- [X] T015 [US1] Implement /calculate API endpoint in src/cli/calculator_cli.py
- [X] T016 [US1] Add input validation and error handling for basic operations
- [X] T017 [US1] Add logging for calculation operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Advanced Arithmetic Operations (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to perform advanced arithmetic operations (exponents, square roots, percentages, etc.)

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by inputting advanced operations and verifying the results match expected mathematical values.

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Unit test for advanced operations (^, sqrt, %, !) in tests/unit/test_calculator_service.py
- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Contract test for advanced operation endpoints in tests/contract/test_calculator_api.py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Extend Calculator model in src/models/calculator.py to support advanced operations
- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement advanced calculation service in src/services/calculator_service.py
- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement advanced operations in src/lib/math_utils.py
- [ ] T023 [US2] Extend /calculate API endpoint to support advanced operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Calculation History (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable users to view their recent calculations to reference previous results without recalculating

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing calculations and then viewing the history of operations and results.

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Unit test for history operations in tests/unit/test_history_service.py
- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Contract test for /history endpoint in tests/contract/test_calculator_api.py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create History model in src/models/history.py
- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement calculation history service in src/services/history_service.py
- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement /history API endpoints (GET, DELETE) in src/cli/calculator_cli.py
- [ ] T029 [US3] Integrate history with calculation operations (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T030 [P] Documentation updates in docs/README.md
- [ ] T031 Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] T032 Performance optimization across all operations
- [ ] T033 [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] T034 Security hardening
- [ ] T035 Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Unit test for basic operations (+, -, *, /) in tests/unit/test_calculator_service.py"
Task: "Contract test for /calculate endpoint in tests/contract/test_calculator_api.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Calculation model in src/models/calculation.py"
Task: "Create Calculator model in src/models/calculator.py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
