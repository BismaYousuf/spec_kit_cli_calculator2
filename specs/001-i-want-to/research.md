# Research Findings: Calculator with All Arithmetic Operations

## Decision: Error Handling for Division by Zero

**Rationale**: Division by zero is a mathematical impossibility that must be handled gracefully. Based on research of calculator standards and user experience best practices, displaying a clear, specific error message is optimal.

**Decision**: Display "Error: Cannot divide by zero" message

**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic "Invalid operation" - less informative to users
- Simple "Math Error" - less descriptive than the chosen option

## Decision: Precision Requirements for Decimal Calculations

**Rationale**: Based on research into calculator standards and typical user needs, 10 decimal places provides sufficient precision for most calculations while maintaining performance.

**Decision**: Support up to 10 decimal places precision

**Alternatives considered**:
- 6 decimal places - sufficient for basic needs but limiting for advanced calculations
- 15 decimal places - excessive for most use cases and could impact performance

## Decision: Advanced Operations to Support

**Rationale**: Research into calculator capabilities shows that exponents, square roots, percentages, factorial, pi, and Euler's number provide comprehensive functionality without excessive complexity.

**Decision**: Support exponents, square roots, percentages, factorial, pi, and Euler's number

**Alternatives considered**:
- Only basic operations (exponents, square roots, percentages) - less feature-rich
- Comprehensive scientific functions (logarithms, trigonometric functions) - potentially more complex than needed

## Technology Stack Research: Python Implementation

**Rationale**: Python was selected as the primary language based on user input. For calculator implementation, Python offers:
- Built-in math capabilities
- Decimal module for precision calculations
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Extensive testing frameworks (pytest)

**Decision**: Use Python 3.11 with decimal module for calculations, tkinter for GUI (if needed), and pytest for testing

**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript (for web-based calculator) - not specified by user
- C# (for Windows forms) - not specified by user
- Java (for cross-platform) - not specified by user

## Performance Considerations

**Rationale**: Based on user requirements and calculator performance standards, calculations should complete within 100ms to provide a responsive user experience.

**Decision**: Implement performance monitoring and ensure all operations complete within 100ms for basic operations and 200ms for complex operations.

## Input Validation Strategy

**Rationale**: Following the Input Validation principle from the constitution, all inputs must be validated before processing to prevent errors and ensure system stability.

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive input validation that:
- Checks for valid number formats
- Validates operation symbols
- Handles edge cases like division by zero
- Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs
