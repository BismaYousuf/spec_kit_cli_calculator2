# Feature Specification: Calculator with All Arithmetic Operations

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "(i want to build a calculator it should perform all athematic operation)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Basic Arithmetic Operations (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) so that I can calculate simple math problems.

**Why this priority**: Basic operations form the core functionality of any calculator and provide immediate value to users for daily calculations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering two numbers and an operation symbol and verifying the correct result is displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** calculator is displaying 0, **When** user inputs "5 + 3 =", **Then** calculator displays "8"
2. **Given** calculator has a number on screen, **When** user inputs an operation followed by another number and equals, **Then** the calculated result is displayed

---

### User Story 2 - Advanced Arithmetic Operations (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to perform advanced arithmetic operations (exponents, square roots, percentages, etc.) so that I can handle more complex mathematical problems.

**Why this priority**: These operations expand the calculator's functionality beyond basic needs for students and professionals.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by inputting advanced operations and verifying the results match expected mathematical values.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** calculator is ready for input, **When** user inputs "4 ^ 2 =", **Then** calculator displays "16"

---

### User Story 3 - Calculation History (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to view my recent calculations so that I can reference previous results without recalculating.

**Why this priority**: Provides convenience for users who need to reference past calculations, though less critical than core calculation functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing calculations and then viewing the history of operations and results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has performed multiple calculations, **When** user accesses history feature, **Then** previous calculations are displayed in chronological order

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user attempts to divide by zero?
- How does system handle calculations with very large numbers?
- What occurs when user enters invalid operations or symbols?
- How does system handle decimal precision and rounding?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Calculator MUST perform mathematical operations with mathematically correct results (Accuracy-First principle)
- **FR-002**: Calculator MUST validate all user inputs before processing and provide clear error messages for invalid inputs (Input Validation principle)  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to perform basic operations (+, -, *, /) with immediate feedback and intuitive interface (Simplicity and Usability principle)
- **FR-004**: System MUST include comprehensive unit tests covering mathematical accuracy for all operations (Test-First principle)
- **FR-005**: Calculator MUST complete standard calculations within 100 milliseconds (Performance Optimization principle)
- **FR-006**: Calculator MUST handle division by zero by displaying an appropriate error message [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact error message content?]
- **FR-007**: Calculator MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific precision requirements for decimal calculations?]
- **FR-008**: Calculator MUST support advanced operations including exponents, square roots, and percentages

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Calculation**: Represents a single mathematical operation with input values, operation type, and result
- **History**: Represents a collection of past calculations that can be recalled by the user

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can perform basic arithmetic operations with 100% mathematical accuracy
- **SC-002**: Calculation results are displayed within 200 milliseconds of pressing equals
- **SC-003**: 95% of users can successfully complete a basic calculation without instruction
- **SC-004**: Error rate for invalid inputs is 0% (all errors handled gracefully with clear messages)
- **SC-005**: At least 90% of users rate the calculator as "easy to use" in user feedback
