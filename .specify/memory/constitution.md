# Calculator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy-First
<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
All calculator operations MUST produce mathematically correct results for all valid inputs within the defined precision limits; All operations MUST be validated against known mathematical standards and edge cases.
<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->

### II. Input Validation
<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
Calculator MUST validate all user inputs before processing; Invalid inputs MUST result in clear error messages without system failure; All boundary conditions and edge cases MUST be handled explicitly.
<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced; Mathematical accuracy tests MUST cover all defined operations with known input/output pairs.
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### IV. Performance Optimization
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
Calculator operations MUST complete within 100 milliseconds for standard calculations; Complex calculations MUST have progress indicators if exceeding 1 second; Resource utilization MUST be optimized for target platform.
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### V. Simplicity and Usability
<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
Calculator interface and API MUST be intuitive and accessible; Features MUST follow the principle of least surprise; Complex operations MUST have clear documentation and examples.
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

## User Experience Standards
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

Calculator MUST provide consistent and predictable user experience across all operations; All user interactions MUST be responsive with immediate feedback; Error messages MUST be clear and actionable for users of all skill levels.
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## Development Workflow
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

All features MUST include comprehensive unit tests covering mathematical accuracy; Code changes MUST pass all existing tests before merging; Peer review REQUIRED for all mathematical implementations to ensure correctness.
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

All calculator implementations MUST comply with this constitution; Any deviation from these principles MUST be documented and approved; Code reviews MUST verify compliance with accuracy and validation principles before merging.
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
